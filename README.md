## About

This app short your too long www adress. App is full responsive. I have decided to show a mobile menu on 620px width. In my opinion, desktop menu stop looking good below this dimensions. You can copy your short link just by clicking the button, so you do not have to use shortcut copy-paste. all your shorted links will be stored in local stored and viewed below the input.

## Build by
